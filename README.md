## 1. Introduction

This C program is designed to generate a specified number (e.g., 10 million) of random 10-digit numbers. It counts the number of these generated numbers that end with '666666' and measures the time taken for the generation process.

## 2. Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you need a C compiler installed on your system. The program is written in standard C and should be compatible with most common C compilers such as GCC.

## 3. Compilation

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the C source code file is located.
Use the following command to compile the program using GCC (replace the file name if it's different in your case):

```sh
# Using GCC
gcc -o lucky main.c
# or using clang
clang -O2 -o lucky main.c
# or with cmake
```

This will create an executable file named lucky in the same directory.

## 4. Execution

After successful compilation, run the program in the terminal by typing:

```sh
./lucky 10000000
```

The program will start generating the random 10-digit numbers. During the process, it will keep track of the numbers that end with '666666'.
Once the generation of the specified number of random numbers is complete, the program will display two important pieces of information:

1. The count of numbers that end with '666666'.
2. The time elapsed during the generation process in an appropriate time unit (e.g., seconds).

## 5. Customization

If you want to change the number of random numbers to be generated, you will need to modify the source code. Look for the variable that defines the quantity of numbers to generate (it should be clearly marked in the code) and adjust its value accordingly. Then, re-compile the program as described in the Compilation section.

## 6. Notes

The random number generation in this program uses the standard C library's random number generation functions. The quality of randomness depends on these functions and the underlying implementation of the C library on your system.
The program's performance may vary depending on your computer's hardware specifications, especially when generating a large number of random numbers.
